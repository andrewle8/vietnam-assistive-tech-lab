# USB Drive Braille Tags

3D printed identification tags for student USB drives. Printed on Bambu Lab P1S in PLA.

## Design

**Option C (primary):** Tag with integrated loop that threads through the drive's keyring hole. Lanyard string attaches to the tag, not the drive directly. Tag becomes the permanent connection point between drive and lanyard.

**Option B (fallback):** C-clip that snaps onto the keyring hole if the loop doesn't fit.

## Specs

- PLA, 0.12mm layer height for crisp braille dots
- Braille dots: 1.5mm diameter, 0.5-0.6mm raised (standard spec)
- Tag size: ~25x15x2.5mm
- Braille number on front, raised print number on back
- Rounded corners
- Numbering: 001-100

## Before Printing

Measure once drives arrive:
- Keyring hole diameter
- Keyring wire thickness
- Test print one tag to confirm fit and strength

## Print

- Parametric model (OpenSCAD or Fusion 360) to generate numbered tags
- ~25 per build plate, 4 prints for full set
