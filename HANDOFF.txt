PC AND USB LABELS
-----------------
- PCs are labeled PC-1 through PC-19
- Student USB drives are labeled STU-001, STU-002, etc.
- Each USB has folders: Documents, Audio, Schoolwork


IF NVDA STOPS TALKING
---------------------
Press Ctrl + Alt + N to restart NVDA.

NVDA starts automatically when the PC turns on. If it doesn't, look for
the NVDA icon on the desktop or in the Start menu.

Restore NVDA Settings:
  If NVDA stops speaking Vietnamese or has wrong settings, use the
  "Khoi Phuc NVDA - Restore NVDA" shortcut on the desktop. This restores
  NVDA to the original lab configuration.

Backup - Windows Narrator:
  The Narrator shortcut (Win+Ctrl+Enter) is DISABLED to prevent accidental
  activation alongside NVDA. If NVDA completely fails, Narrator can be
  re-enabled through Settings > Accessibility > Narrator.


NVDA LEARNING TOOLS
-------------------
These features help beginners learn NVDA and are useful for training sessions:

  Input Help Mode (NVDA+1):
    Learning mode -- press any key to hear what it does. Press NVDA+1 again
    to exit. This is the #1 beginner learning tool.

  Screen Curtain (NVDA+Shift+S):
    Turns screen black for privacy and battery savings. Press again to turn
    screen back on.

  Adjust Speech Speed (NVDA+Ctrl+Up/Down arrows):
    Speed up or slow down NVDA's voice.


ESSENTIAL NVDA SHORTCUTS
------------------------
Note: "NVDA key" = Insert or Caps Lock (both work).

  NVDA+1              Input Help (learning mode)
  NVDA+T              Read window title
  NVDA+B              Read all (say all)
  Tab / Shift+Tab     Navigate controls

  NVDA+Q              Quit NVDA

LOW-VISION MODE
---------------
Some students may have partial vision. These tools are pre-configured:

  Win + Plus (+)                   Launch Magnifier (200% zoom, full-screen)
  Win + Minus (-)                  Zoom out while Magnifier is running
  Win + Esc                        Close Magnifier
  Win + Left Alt + Print Screen    Toggle High Contrast mode

Magnifier and NVDA can run at the same time for students with some
remaining vision who also benefit from speech output.


SWITCHING LANGUAGE
------------------
Windows is set to Vietnamese by default. To switch to English:

  1. Open the "Doi Ngon Ngu - Switch Language" shortcut on the desktop
  2. A message will confirm the switch
  3. Sign out and sign back in for the change to take effect

This is useful for staff or volunteers who need English temporarily.
The keyboard input method (UniKey/Telex) is separate and works in
both languages.


QUICK HEALTH CHECK
------------------
To check if everything is working on a PC:

  1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
     (Start menu > type "PowerShell" > right-click > Run as Administrator)
  2. Run once (first time only):
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
  3. Navigate to the project folder:
     cd C:\path\to\vietnam-assistive-tech-lab
  4. Run the audit:
     .\Scripts\7-Audit.ps1

The script checks all software, Windows settings, NVDA config, and
remote management. Shows green (OK), yellow (warning), or red (problem).
